			<p>Hello! My name is Nik Sokol, and welcome to my photography archive.</p><br>
			<p>I grew up surrounded by the arts, receiving my first camera at the age of five, and later began shadowing my parents
			photography business throughout setup, production, and editing. Developing my own sense of style, I have come to enjoy 
			taking photographs of nature, architecture, and macro subjects.</p><br>
			<p>As just one facet of my creative expression, photography serves as a visual representation of my own reality. Combined
			with my professional interests and other personal endeavors in creative writing, digital art, and short films â€“ these passions helped
			show that my greatest authenticity can be found in writing and creating art.</p> <br>
